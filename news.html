  <h2>Declaration of Independence<br><small>of the Republic of Fridomia</small></h2>
  <p><strong>Signed on April 21, 2025</strong></p>
  
<p>We, the founding citizens of the Republic of Fridomia, moved by an unshakable belief in peace, freedom, and dignity for all, do solemnly and peacefully declare our independence and sovereign existence as a free nation, hereafter known as the Republic of Fridomia.</p>

<p>Established in the unclaimed and peaceful land of Marie Byrd Land, Antarcticaâ€”a region ungoverned by any recognized stateâ€”we claim our place among the community of nations, not by conquest, but by principle.
  In accordance with international law, and respecting the Antarctic Treaty, we assert our sovereignty symbolically and peacefully, with no intent to disturb the ecological harmony of the land we cherish.</p>

<p>Founded on the ideals of Freedom, Passion, and Integrity in the Pursuit of Peace, Fridomia is a republic of purpose. 
  We seek not domination, but understanding; not borders, but bridges. Our nation shall be built by dreamers, thinkers, artists, peacemakers, and all who dare to imagine a better world.</p>

<h3>We hereby proclaim:</h3>
<ul>
<li>That Fridomia is a sovereign, independent republic, free from any control or governance by foreign entities.</li>

<li>That our constitution, laws, and symbols represent the will of our citizens and the essence of our values.</li>

<li>That our citizenship shall be open to all people of the world who share our vision and commitment to peace.</li>

<li>That we shall coexist peacefully with all other nations and peoples, and extend friendship to those who respect our sovereignty.</li>
</ul>

Let it be known, on this day and for all days forward, that the Republic of Fridomia stands as a symbol of what humanity can be when we choose love over hate, peace over conflict, and vision over fear.
<p>
Signed with hope,
  </p>
